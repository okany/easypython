### Simple python scripts

* test1 - finds the kth minimum number in a list
* test2 - finds the kth minimum number in a list (another version)
* test3 - manipulates a number string by adding a "*" between two consecutive even numbers and "-" between two consecutive odd numbers
* test4 - mingles two strings after crerating chunks in size n e.g. ABCDEFG and 1234567890 with 2 char chunks -> AB12CD34EF56G7890
* test5 - finds the common words in two lists
* test6 - demonstrates trying and catching exceptions while getting an a positive integer as an input and printing its square
* test7 - counts the occurrence of each word in a list
* test8 - finds duplicate characters in a string
* test9 - determines if two strings are anagram or not
